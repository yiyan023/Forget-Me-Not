# Forget Me Not 🚀

## What is Forget Me Not? ⁉️
Forget Me Not is a nostalgic mobile application that combines augmented reality and journalling to help users relive their most magical memories. 

## Inspiration ✨
Whether it is your old elementary school, your favourite beach, or a special vacation spot across the world, revisiting places from your past can cause the most cherished memories to flood back. However, these memories always remain forgotten until a lucky coincidence causes you to reminisce on everything that once was. To augment feelings of nostalgia and preserve your most treasured memories, we wanted to incorporate journaling and augmented reality to help people relive special moments of their past.

## What does it do? 👩‍💻
- Opening our application redirects you to our responsive landing page, which allows users to switch between a world map and the augmented reality. This interactive user interface was built using Dart, Flutter and SwiftUI.

- Users can revist their old messages and pinpoint the location on Google Maps through a secure data storage system that was made possible using Python, Flask and MongoDB. 
- Users can also select different AR objects and attach nostalgic letters that they can revisit many years later!
